# AML & KYC Risk Monitoring Analysis

**A comprehensive simulation of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance workflows used in banking and financial institutions.**

---

## Project Overview

This project simulates the end-to-end AML monitoring and compliance operations workflow used by banks, fintech companies, and Big 4 risk advisory teams. It demonstrates how financial institutions detect suspicious activity, investigate alerts, manage escalations, and report compliance metrics to leadership.

The project replicates real-world processes including:

- Transaction monitoring and suspicious activity detection
- Customer risk profiling and KYC verification
- AML alert generation and triage
- Analyst investigation workflows
- Escalation management and enhanced due diligence
- Compliance reporting and executive dashboards

---

## Business Objective

The primary objective was to build a realistic AML operations simulation that mirrors the daily responsibilities of compliance and risk analysts. This includes:

- Generating rule-based alerts for suspicious transactions
- Simulating customer onboarding and KYC risk assessment
- Modeling investigation and escalation processes
- Producing management-ready compliance reports
- Creating analyst dashboards for monitoring and decision-making

This project serves as a practical demonstration of AML monitoring capabilities relevant to roles in:

- AML/Financial Crime teams in banks and fintechs
- Risk and Compliance advisory at Big 4 firms
- Regulatory reporting and audit support functions

---

## Industry Context

In real financial institutions, AML operations follow a structured lifecycle:

1. **Transaction Monitoring Systems** continuously scan customer activity against predefined rules (high-value transfers, rapid transaction patterns, high-risk geographies).

2. **Alerts** are generated when transactions or customer behaviors deviate from expected norms. These alerts enter a queue for analyst review.

3. **KYC Analysts** assess customer risk profiles using onboarding data, PEP (Politically Exposed Person) flags, sanctions screening, and geographic exposure.

4. **Investigations** involve reviewing transaction history, customer documentation, and risk indicators to determine whether activity is legitimate or suspicious.

5. **Escalations** occur when cases require senior review, enhanced due diligence, or potential Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) filing.

6. **Management Reporting** provides leadership with visibility into alert volumes, escalation trends, high-risk customer segments, and KYC compliance gaps.

This project replicates each stage of this operational lifecycle using realistic data and analyst-style decision logic.

## Key Risk Insights

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| Total Alerts Generated | 160 | Suspicious activity flagged for review |
| Escalated Investigations | 37 | Cases requiring senior analyst attention |
| High-Risk Customers | 123 | Elevated monitoring required |
| Pending KYC Customers | 161 | Compliance remediation needed |
| Fraudulent Transactions | 8,213 | Confirmed fraud within dataset |
| PEP Customers | 28 | Politically Exposed Persons under enhanced scrutiny |
| Sanctions-Flagged | 7 | OFAC/UN watchlist matches requiring blocking review |
| High-Value Transactions | 1,673,570 | Activity exceeding 200,000 threshold |

**Key Observations:**
- High-value transaction alerts represent the largest alert category, indicating need for source-of-funds verification processes
- 23% of alerts (37/160) required escalation, reflecting appropriate risk triage sensitivity
- Pending KYC exposure (161 customers) represents a material compliance gap requiring immediate remediation
